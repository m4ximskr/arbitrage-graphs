# ArbitrageGraphs

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.2.

## Setting up environment and dependencies

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (together with npm).

Run `npm install -g @angular/cli to install` [Angular](https://angular.dev/) globally (-g) to make sure you donâ€™t have to install it separately for every project

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Specify port if needed `--port 4201` (default 4200)

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

Run `ng test --include="**/your-component-name.component.spec.ts"` to execute specified test file.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
